## 1. Grok the Circuit
### Which is the inverting input? Which is the non-inverting input? Explain your reasoning briefly
### What is the allowable common-mode input voltage range of this circuit?
### If the output voltage were fixed, what would the output current be in terms of I1 and I2?
### Do we need to make the bias current sunk by M3 and M4 equal to the diff-pairbias current,Ib?
### Design a bias circuit for the folded-cascode amplifier that receivesinput from a single current source.
## 2. Schematic Capture and simulation

### Voltage Transfer Characteristics

### Voltage-to-Current Transfer Characteristics

### Loopgain

### Unity-Gain Follower Frequency Response

### Small-Signal Step Response

### Large-Amplitude Step Response

## 3. Layout Design

## 4. Layout Versus Schematic
